Lamport & Vector Clock Simulator
This project is a web-based simulator that visually demonstrates the concepts of Lamport's logical clocks and Vector clocks in a distributed system. It provides an interactive way to understand how these algorithms help in ordering events in a distributed environment.

This application is built with React and styled with Tailwind CSS.

Live Demo
You can see a live version of this project here: https://shubhammmyadav.github.io/Lamport-Vector-Clock-Simulator/

Features
Interactive Simulation: Visually create processes and events.

Lamport's Logical Clock: See how Lamport timestamps are assigned to events.

Vector Clocks: Observe how vector clocks capture causal relationships between events.

Clear Visualization: The state of each process's clock is clearly displayed and updated in real-time.

Responsive Design: The application is usable on different screen sizes.

Getting Started
Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

Prerequisites
You need to have Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed on your computer.

Node.js (which comes with npm)

Installation
Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/shubhammmyadav/Lamport-Vector-Clock-Simulator.git

Navigate to the project directory:

cd Lamport-Vector-Clock-Simulator

Install the dependencies:
Using npm:

npm install

Or using yarn:

yarn install

Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run the following commands:

npm start or yarn start
Runs the app in development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser. The page will reload if you make edits.

npm test or yarn test
Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

npm run build or yarn build
Builds the app for production to the build folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

npm run eject or yarn eject
Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can’t go back!

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can eject at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.
